  <h2>Cambridge City Council 2017</h2>

<div class="container">
  <div class="row intro">
    <div class="col-xs-10">
      <p>For the last few election cycles, I've sent around a page with rankings of the Cambridge City Council candidates, with descriptions of their positions on key issues and my perceptions of them from campaign events.</p>
      <p>In 2013, one friend of mine told me how useful my ranking was, especially after she moved some candidates around to suit her own priorities.</p>
      <p>I think that's a great idea, so since 2015, I've provided this <strong>customizable voter guide</strong>. You can click and drag the candidates' portraits up and down to re-arrange their position in the list. I'll tell you my opinions, and a couple of reasons why your ranking might differ. (Remember that you can rank as many candidates as you like, and lower-ranked candidates on your ballot will not hurt the higher-ranked candidates.) Once you've arranged the candidates to your liking, printing this page will hide the descriptions and give you a one-page voter's guide that you can bring with you into the voting booth.</p>
      <p>Be sure to vote on <strong>Tuesday, November 7</strong> (that's really soon). This is important. The 2013 election was decided by a margin of 20 votes.</p>

        <p>Adriane is an extremely competent and informed advocate for housing. Any question thrown at her in the debates that I went to, she had a good, informed answer, backed up by data. Also just a positive and friendly person. I believe that she will be a good representative of all of Cambridge, but especially of renters and people facing housing insecurity.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://vote.cambridgecivic.com/gebru.htm">Samuel Gebru</a></h2>
        <p>Samuel Gebru focuses on economic justice, and a step toward his goals is more mixed-income housing. He's proposed fees for vacant and underutilized housing, which from what I've heard are having roughly the intended effect in cities where they've been tried such as Vancouver. He also advocates public financing of elections, which I think would be good for Cambridge. Some other candidates that advocate public elections make it their main issue and a distraction from policy, but Samuel puts policy first.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://vote.cambridgecivic.com/kelley.htm">Craig Kelley</a></h2>
        <p class="incumbent">Incumbent</p>
        <p>Craig Kelley is our strongest advocate for the environment. This is not to say that the other candidates are bad for the environment. But Craig Kelley stands out here.</p>
        <p>He consistently gets endorsements from the Sierra Club, he used to volunteer for Greenpeace, he took the lead on banning plastic bags, and he promotes car-free transportation, especially infrastructure for bikes.</p>
        <p>He actually has an idiosyncratic position on bike lanes -- his view is that bike lanes alongside traffic get bicyclists killed, and if the bike lane can't be entirely separate, bikes should be in the flow of traffic instead. So you might see him surprisingly advocating against bike lanes sometimes.</p>
        <p>Unlike my other top choices, Craig does not have the endorsement of A Better Cambridge. He didn't even participate in their questionnaire. I believe he disagrees with ABC on minor points, and he often talks about being careful about the design of new developments. There's nothing wrong with that as an honest position, it's just that most candidates who say that use it as an anti-density talking point, a concern they can use to block <i>all</i> new buildings because no design will satisfy them.</p><p>But Craig has established by now that he is pro-density, as density is an environmental benefit. You can't make a walkable, bikeable city without density. He talks about how you can convert people away from being NIMBY if you can convince them that new development will be a tasteful, well-designed part of the neighborhood.</p>

        <p class="incumbent">Incumbent</p>
        <p>Denise Simmons has been a great representative of Cambridge and a great mayor. In Cambridge, the mayor has only slightly more power than any other council member; what's more important is that they bring people together, and represent the spirit of the city on issues that are larger than us. Denise has done this well in her terms as mayor, including her previous term when she became the first openly-lesbian mayor in the US.</p>
        <p>Simmons spends some of her time on a constituency who can't vote for her, because they don't live here, yet. She helps low-income people navigate the affordable-housing waitlist process, including guides written in Haitian Creole, so that not all the subsidies go to people who are well-connected and proficient in English.</p>
        <p>In general, a Cambridge where Denise Simmons doesn't get re-elected is a Cambridge I don't recognize. There are other candidates I find more exciting, but I think she has done well and deserves to stay on the council.</p>

        <p class="incumbent">Incumbent</p>
        <p>Marc is a housing advocate, a fighter against poverty, and a policy wonk. Last election, I liked enough of what he had to say that I ranked him #1.</p>
        <p>What changed? Just one thing: within the past two years, there was a petition to downzone most of Riverside. This is a neighborhood where it's illegal to build a house like the houses that are already there, or to add so much as a shed to your house, and the petition was to make it even more illegal. I went to City Hall to oppose that petition and was very surprised to find Marc speaking for the supporting side.</p>
        <p>This was very surprising, given everything I've heard him say in favor of density. Is it different when it comes to his neighborhood? Was he coerced into it by his supporters? I don't know, but it makes me support him less, even though I still agree strongly with his policy positions.</p>

        <p>I haven't seen a lot of Paul Toner in this campaign. I see he's been collecting a bunch of union endorsements and yard signs and stuff, but I have to go look him up on the Web to see what he stands for: representing retirees, partnering with education and industry to help local students prosper, and a "regional approach" to housing and transportation issues.</p>
        <p>He does say the magic words, which are that we can't just subsidize our way out of the housing crisis. I'm not sure what exactly is going to be different about his regional approach -- what makes him uniquely qualified to negotiate with Boston and Somerville? This is a task that past councillors have found very difficult.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://vote.cambridgecivic.com/siddiqui.htm">Sumbul Siddiqui</a></h2>
        <p>Somehow, Sumbul Siddiqui managed to get a respectable score (though short of an endorsement) from the pro-housing A Better Cambridge, while also getting an endorsement from the anti-housing Cambridge Residents' Alliance / Our Revolution. That's kind of amazing.</p>
        <p>This could mean one of two things: either she's a uniter who everyone likes, who will bring people together and find compromise; or she's just a politician talking out of both sides of her mouth.</p>
        <p>So far I'm inclined to believe the first, though. I've heard her speak at all the candidate events I went to. I've found the things she said generally agreeable, and her credentials as a Cambridge native who grew up in public schools and subsidized housing give her a lot of credibility.</p>
        <p>In her policies, she's a little bit focused on homeownership and single-family homes -- though she also mentions triple-deckers, which we need more of and are generally not allowed by our current zoning. And she explicitly mentions the most important place to build new, denser housing: near transit and workplaces. Outside of these areas, I worry that her affordable-housing plans sound like mere juggling of tax incentives, which won't work for long, but her motivations are fine.</p>

        <p>Tim Toomey used to have two elected positions, as a state representative and a city councillor, a situation I considered not quite reasonable. He lost the state rep position in 2016 to Mike Connolly, and I'd say it's because of his massive blunder of opposing marijuana legalization while the public was passing a referendum in favor of it.</p>
        <p>Aside from that, he seems fine, just a little bit bland. His big issue right now is creating affordable housing in space that's becoming available near Harvard Square, for which he says he withstands "unprecedented attacks" from the neighbors. I'm glad he's standing up for that issue. But I can't get excited about Tim Toomey. It seems like if you needed to point a finger at the Establishment, it's basically him.</p>

        <p>Richard didn't respond to the ABC questionnaire and I don't know enough about his positions from other sources, but I see he's already talking about raising the inclusionary housing requirement to 25%. Why not keep going until we end up as the Bay Area where people chant "100% affordable or none at all!" and get none at all?</p>
        <p>The purpose of the inclusionary zoning requirement is to get affordable housing whose subsidies are already paid for. 20% appears to be a workable percentage. The more you raise the percentage, the more insanely expensive the market rate has to be to pay for the affordable housing.</p>
        <p>That said, apparently he was reasonably well-liked on the School Committee, and he's not a CRA-endorsed candidate, which counts for something.</p>

        <p>I was almost on board with the things Gwen Volmar was saying, but I don't really trust her. She does the kind of politics that involves getting really mad about things, and it turns out some of those things aren't real.</p><p>There was a policy she was railing against at the ABC forum that she says is a massive loophole in inclusionary zoning, where developers get to build the expensive units in one place and the affordable units in a separate location that's marginalized and undesirable. That would very much defeat the purpose of inclusionary zoning and would be something to get mad about, if it were true, but it isn't. After corrections, she kind of backed off and said it's something that happens in other cities and could happen here.</p>
        <p>She was also taking up the mantle of being a representative of low-income residents, but, here's the thing. She's an academic. She is low-income as a lifestyle choice. I appreciate people who pursue academia and I recognize how badly underpaid they are, but her take on class struggle sounds pretty inauthentic to me.</p>
        <p>As a commenter on Reddit pointed out when I started to be swayed by what she said in a forum, "She just makes things up."</p>

        <p>Jan Devereux represents a vision of Cambridge as a rich, homogeneous suburb, not as a diverse and thriving city. You will see her campaign signs on nice detached single-family houses with nice yards that you definitely can't afford. In the previous election, she touted the fact that she once opposed a sidewalk repair because the concrete was the wrong color.</p>

        <p>If you want to see what her policies look like, look at West Cambridge, the richest, least dense, least racially diverse part of our city.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://vote.cambridgecivic.com/okamoto.htm">Nadya Okamoto</a></h2>
        <p>Nadya Okamoto tells the story about how she escaped domestic violence and joined relatives in Cambridge, which became a safe, welcoming place for her. And now it's important to her that other people in her situation can f*** right off, because  Cambridge is full now.</p>

        <p>Am I caricaturing her a bit much? She hasn't given us much else to go on. Her platform is pretty weak and reflects her lack of experience.</p>
        
        <p>It seems like she wanted to put a City Council run on her resume, she looked around for a platform to campaign on, and CRA gave her one, even though it doesn't match her story at all. She's a young candidate failing to represent young voters. If so far she's only lived with relatives and then in a dorm, she may not have experienced the search for a place to live in Cambridge.</p>

        <p>If I suspected anyone of being a poorly-programmed robot posing as a City Council candidate, it would be Dan Lenke. He strings together nice-sounding words without ever forming a relevant, meaningful sentence.</p>
        <p>I appreciate that he ran; everyone's been so serious about this election and we've been kind of running low on comic-relief candidates.</p>

        <p>Talk show host who is running as a publicity stunt. He is strongly pro-car and thinks Cambridge should have more parking spaces. I guess this makes sense, because where else does anyone else listen to a radio talk show?</p>

        <p>Perennial candidate. Talks about his uncle who worked for FDR a lot, as if we're supposed to be impressed. The claim he repeats is "My uncle wrote the Second Bill of Rights", which refers to an FDR campaign prop with large-print words on it like "A Good Job", not exactly a defining document of our time.</p><p>This guy is messed up, frankly. He is not going to solve his problems by running for City Council. I don't understand where he even gets the signatures to get on the ballot every time.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://vote.cambridgecivic.com/zondervan.htm">Quinton Zondervan</a></h2>

        <p>A loud populist and a fake environmentalist. He advocates for low-density sprawl. It's as if he believes the environment is a bubble over Cambridge, and anyone pushed outside of the bubble doesn't affect the environment anymore. He touts alternatives to driving, but he supports policies that displace people to outlying towns where they have no alternative to driving.</p>
        <p>His solution to the housing shortage seems to be to shout at people until they lower the prices. "Just BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING", he tweets angrily while opposing all policies that would allow building affordable housing. He even opposes inclusionary zoning, as to him, 20% affordable is 80% evil.</p>
        <p>He talks about his campaign as a part of "Our Revolution" and a way of fighting back against the Trump administration. In this election, he's not running against the Trump administration. He's running against progressives.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://vote.cambridgecivic.com/levy.htm">Ilan Levy</a></h2>

        <p>There are candidates I support and candidates I oppose, some of them strongly. But for all the other candidates, I can say that if they implemented their policies, there would still be a Cambridge. Not so with Ilan Levy.</p>

        <p>He considers the entire city to be in a conspiracy against him and his neighborhood, and his response is to start fights at community meetings (he proudly claimed this at a forum) and to propose to abolish the entire Plan E government. He wants to replace our ranked, proportional voting system with a system of districts and a directly-elected mayor, like in Boston, where most candidates run unopposed.</p>

        <p>Cambridge's system of government is remarkably inclusive and effective. It lets us enact progressive policies while running a budget surplus and earning a AAA bond rating. Our system of government has done well for us, and without it, we might as well get annexed by Boston.</p>
