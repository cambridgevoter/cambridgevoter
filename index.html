  <div class="intro">
    <p>For the last few election cycles, I've sent around a page with rankings of the Cambridge City Council candidates, with descriptions of their positions on key issues and my perceptions of them from campaign events.</p>
    <p>In 2013, one friend of mine told me how useful my ranking was, especially after she moved some things around to suit her own priorities.</p>
    <p>I think that's a great idea, so this year, I've provided this <strong>Choose Your Own Voter Guide</strong>. You can click and drag the candidates' portraits up and down to re-arrange their position in the list. I'll tell you my opinions, and a couple of reasons why your ranking might differ. Once you've arranged the candidates to your liking, printing this page will hide the descriptions and give you a one-page voter's guide that you can bring with you into the voting booth.</p>

        <h2>Marc McGovern</h2>

        <p>I have been thoroughly impressed with Marc as I have seen him talk at Cambridge candidate events. The key thing I want to describe about him is his passionate reasonableness. When a candidate takes a position that's stupid, Marc will calmly but emphatically explain why it's stupid, who would be hurt by it, and the more reasonable thing he would do instead. At the CEOC forum on poverty and economic opportunity, he showed deep understanding and compassion for the poorer residents of our city.</p>
        <p>Marc makes raising the Cambridge minimum wage to $15 per hour a part of his platform. This is something that we need given the high cost of living here.</p>
        <p>He advocates growth and density, but he's sure to clarify that <em>some</em> development is harmful -- particularly speculation that won't increase the number of livable places. He'll use zoning and ordinances not as a weapon against new development, but a way for the City to encourage the kind of development it wants.</p>
        <p><strong>Drag up if</strong> McGovern's passionate reasonableness makes you wish you could give someone a vote higher than #1.</p>
        <p><strong>Drag down if</strong> you don't support the minimum wage increase.</p>

        <h2>Leland Cheung</h2>

        <p>If you are a renter in Cambridge, or if you have friends who rent and you don't want them to have to move out of Cambridge the next time they move, you should support Leland Cheung, because he is the strongest advocate of your interests.</p>

        <p>Cheung is a champion of new residential construction, to a greater extent than the rest of his slate. Whatever is on the table, Cheung will be pushing for zoning that allows additional height, additional density, and additional units set aside as affordable as part of the deal, because the housing crunch is a vast problem and we can't solve it by being timid. He'll compromise, but he'll be sure to establish what we want first.</p>

        <p>I have heard people shouting at Cheung at campaign events, "Why are you building luxury housing?", as if he's the one making it expensive. New housing in Cambridge is so valuable and so expensive because there isn't enough of it. Its price is a sign that we're filling demand and that there's a long way to go. We need higher density in appropriate places, before <em>all</em> housing turns into luxury housing and the soul of the city disappears.</p>

        <p>Not all of Cheung's platform is about building. In his time on the council, he's pushed for the expansion of Zipcar and the introduction of Hubway into the city. He also aims to make the government more accessible through information technology, although so far, useful improvements in the city's IT have been slow to appear.</p>

        <p><strong>Drag up if</strong> you care about the city's information technology and you think Cheung will finally make it work.</p>

        <p><strong>Drag down if</strong> towers in Kendall Square make you uncomfortable.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-8 desc">
        <h2>Minka vanBeuzekom</h2>
        <p>She wants you to just call her "Minka", and she very narrowly lost her seat in the last election. I think it's time to bring her back.</p>

        <p>She runs a home-grown campaign that doesn't seem to have any influences from out-of-Cambridge interest groups, and she has worked on protecting the environment and open spaces. The theme of her campaign that she keeps returning to is "health", and while I don't understand why this is a big issue (who's on the other side of it?), it can't hurt.</p>

        <p>She is a bit too cautious about development for me. She wants new development to be the responsibility of non-profits, and to me this sounds like it's slow and it's turning down a whole lot of tax revenue.</p>

        <p>But housing isn't the only issue, and I feel that she's the best challenger in this election. At candidate forums, she is a voice of reason among the challengers. There's one particularly nasty incumbent (Nadeem Mazen) that I want off of the council, and supporting a good challenger is key to doing so.</p>

        <p><strong>Drag up if</strong> you want to be cautious about new development, or if you want to give your strongest support to a non-incumbent. Also drag up to support more women on the City Council.</p>

        <p><strong>Drag down if</strong> new housing is important to you and you believe non-profits won't be enough to make it happen.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-8 desc">
        <h2>Denise Simmons</h2>
        <p>Simmons is concerned with a side of Cambridge we might not often see. She meets with Cantabrigians in poor neighborhoods and helping them navigate city services that they need. She publishes a guide on how to have the best chance of getting an affordable-housing subsidy, in English and Haitian Creole.</p>
        <p>She has the distinction of having been the first black lesbian mayor in the United States. She's currently the only woman on our City Council.</p>
        <p>She is on board with plans to get us the housing we need. The city has recently signed up for a Master Plan from Utile, a local think tank for city development, and <em>everyone</em> seems to approve of Utile, even those candidates who firmly oppose the Unity Slate. Simmons was the chair of the housing committee, and she led us through the search process that got us a plan from a well-respected, unanimously-supported agency.</p>

        <p><strong>Drag up if</strong> you want to support more women on the city council, or more diversity in general, because seriously she checks every box.</p>

        <p><strong>Drag down if</strong> you're peeved that she compared it to "domestic violence" when fringe candidate James Williamson yelled at a debate moderator at the CEOC forum. He did deserve a rebuke, but that's not domestic violence.</p>

        <h2>Craig Kelley</h2>
        <p>Craig Kelley is our strongest advocate for the environment. This is not to say that the other candidates are bad for the environment -- the environment is a priority for every slate running in this election. But Craig Kelley stands out here.</p>
        <p>He consistently gets endorsements from the Sierra Club, he used to volunteer for Greenpeace, he took the lead on banning plastic bags, and he promotes car-free transportation, especially infrastructure for bikes.</p>
        <p><strong>Drag up if</strong> you would like to support a candidate with a <em>really strong</em> track record on the environment, or if you are a cyclist who wants to ensure cyclists are represented on the council.</p>
        <p><strong>Drag down if</strong> you think the most important thing for cyclists is protected bike lanes. According to suddenly-not-a-candidate John Sanzone (also a cyclist), Kelley's focus is on making bikes part of street traffic, and he's unenthusiastic about protected bike lanes.</p>

        <h2>Tim Toomey</h2>
        <p>The man so nice we elected him twice. Tim Toomey fits the classic archetype of a local politician, and he's so good at that that he was elected to both the City Council and the State House.</p>
        <p>I have no problem at all with his platform. Smart growth, open space, pedestrian safety, all that good stuff. I do worry that by holding two offices, he doesn't dedicate enough time to representing us as a city. I didn't even get to hear from him at one candidate forum because I arrived late and he excused himself quite early.</p>
        <p>He seems like a bit of an empty suit to me, but I've met people who genuinely like him. And as a member of the Unity Slate, he stands with candidates I support, so I'll give him some of my support as well.</p>
        <p><strong>Drag up if</strong> you feel genuinely well-represented by this powerhouse of politics.</p>
        <p><strong>Drag down if </strong> you think no one should be allowed to hold two political offices at the same time.</p>

        <p>Does he exist? I've gone to numerous candidate forums and I have never met or even seen this guy. Apparently being a figurehead mayor is a very demanding job that leaves no time for meeting his constituents. However, he stands with other candidates I support.</p>
        <p><strong>Drag up if</strong> you have met him.</p>

        <h2>Mariko Davidson</h2>
        <p>In some aspects, Mariko Davidson sounds great. She's a supporter of campaign finance reform, and quite relatedly, she's running the leanest serious campaign I've seen. She says that she'll bring experience from the time she's spent working in Menino's administration in Boston, and she aims to get out the youth vote.</p>
        <p>She is the only candidate on the Slate for Cambridge who I can believe possibly represents what they claim to stand for: young candidates getting out the youth vote. The other two candidates on her slate, Nadeem Mazen and Romaine Waite, are supported by the Cambridge Residents' Alliance, so they definitely do not stand on the side of young renters.</p>
        <p>Here's the problem. She works really closely with Nadeem Mazen, who has been an incredibly destructive force in Cambridge politics. Over time I've seen her drift away from her own positions and align more with Mazen. She once said she wanted to avoid a future where Cambridge turns into San Francisco; now she's allied with two candidates who will bring us down exactly that path.</p>
        <p>I do not understand her position on housing. She's not a CRA candidate herself, but she uses the CRA's twisted economics to claim that building new housing will make prices go <em>up</em>. She intends to solve the housing problem with "data" and "algorithms". Data and algorithms are great, but you can't just compute your way out of a housing crunch, you need a plan.</p>
        <p><strong>Drag up if</strong> you want more representation from women or young candidates, and if you believe she's sincere. Also drag up if campaign finance reform is a key issue, and you're looking for a candidate who supports publicly-financed campaigns while also being a reasonable, non-fringe candidate.</p>
        <p><strong>Drag down if</strong> you are concerned that her own positions are weak enough that she'll only act as an extra vote for the interests of Nadeem Mazen and the Cambridge Residents' Alliance.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-8 desc">
        <h2>Dennis Benzan</h2>
        <p>Politically, Dennis Benzan is totally fine. I'm sure you can find all kinds of nice things to say about his term on City Council. But I form the opinions by which I actually distinguish good candidates from each other by listening to them at candidate forums, and there Benzan has been going off topic and putting his personal vendettas on display. Recently, it led him to make a comment that actually offended me.</p>

        <p>I'll tell you what I've learned from these candidate forums: Dennis Benzan really hates Nadeem Mazen. It's like flames, flames on the side of his face. Now, I can identify with this, as I don't like Nadeem Mazen either and I haven't even had to work with him for two years. But I think Benzan has been a bit distracted by his loathing of Mazen, to the point where he brings it up in public repeatedly in the strangest of contexts.</p>

        <p>At Thursday's CEOC forum, Benzan went on an off-topic rant about people who go to grad school at MIT and come out thinking they know how to run the city. He said something derisive about businesses in Central Square. The moderator eventually stopped him and told him this was inappropriate.</p>

        <p>I've been a grad student at MIT, and I promise you most of us weren't dreaming up ways to screw up Cambridge, so don't blame us for the unpleasant person you had to work with. MIT is not a factory for producing narcissistic politicians. There is no one to blame for Mazen's personality but Mazen.</p>

        <p>Benzan's comment reminded me of some of the "town vs. gown" tension of previous Cambridge elections, where students could be the scapegoat for every problem in the city because they don't tend to vote. I wonder if he even thought about the fact that he was also attacking Leland Cheung and Mariko Davidson. I can only give Benzan my most tepid support.</p>

        <p><strong>Drag up if</strong> you aren't bothered by any of this, or you want to stick it to Nadeem Mazen that much more.</p>

        <p><strong>Drag down if</strong> you identify with the students of this city, and don't appreciate a candidate using MIT grad students as a scapegoat.</p>

        <h2>Mike Connolly</h2>
        <p>When we get to this point in my ranking, we're talking about candidates I don't actually support. But I'm writing this for the possibility that someone who firmly disagrees with me on housing will arrive here and want to hear my suggestions based on other issues.</p>

        <p>Mike Connolly firmly believes that the Cambridge housing market is an unexplainable economic anomaly, such that building more housing will make prices go up. (Cambridge commentator Saul Tannebaum attributes this to confusing causation with correlation: "<a href="https://twitter.com/stannenb/status/654809007496892417">Wave a dead chicken in Central Square and costs go up.</a>")</p>

        <p>I recognize there are two sides to the housing issue, though I don't understand how you can support Connolly's side without being a hardened protectionist with no compassion for renters. But maybe I am wrong. And if I am wrong, I guess you should support Mike Connolly considerably more than I do.</p>

        <p>If somehow you subtract out housing as an issue from this election, Connolly looks pretty good. He has a great track record on the environment. When Net Zero (an environmental initiative that is now part of Cambridge's building code) was first proposed, people called it "the Connolly petition". At the CEOC's forum on poverty, he gave good answers that stood out even though they were not his campaign's talking points. (He later lamented that he didn't get to talk about housing.)</p>

        <p>However, keep in mind that the Cambridge Residents' Alliance, the only Super PAC in Cambridge, sends out campaign materials on his behalf. The CRA opposes new development, and their attitude toward young renters ranges from callous to overtly hostile.</p>

        <p><strong>Drag up if</strong> you agree with him that it's possible to get more affordability with less housing.</p>

        <h2>Jan Devereux</h2>

        <p>A blank slate for the CRA to write on. Nobody seems to know what she really stands for besides an abundance of caution on new development, down to wanting to halt sidewalk repair because the sidewalk was slightly the wrong color. Some have noticed that her campaign contributions seem to come from very rich Cambridge residents, and on top of that the Cambridge Residents' Alliance sends out campaign materials on her behalf. You will see her campaign signs on lovely houses that you could not afford in your wildest dreams.</p>

        <p>She gets this spot on my ranking at all because, despite that I disagree with her on her key issue, she seems to be reasonably friendly and sane.</p>

        <h2>Gregg Moree</h2>
        <p>Mostly harmless. A perennial candidate whose campaign is entirely funded by himself. I have never seen him support something I actively oppose, but his political positions are hard to interpret.</p>

        <p>In 2011 he wrote this amazing start to <a href="http://vote.rwinters.com/moree.htm">his campaign platform on vote.rwinters.com</a>:</p>

        <blockquote><p>To the people of Cambridge,</p> <p>Here is what I meant when I said hydroponic greenhouse. Look, there is no dirt.</p></blockquote>

        <p>A bit of a slimy guy, though. At the only candidate forum I saw him attend, he ended his closing statement with "I love all you beautiful women in the audience". In 2007 there was a serious charge against him by his ex-wife, but he was acquitted.</p>

        <p>By no means do I consider him a <em>good</em> candidate. I've put him here in my ranking to indicate the fact that I think many candidates have political positions that are worse.</p>

        <p><strong>Drag up if</strong> you're considering voting for Deez Nuts in 2016.</p>

        <p>He acts disarmingly reasonable for most of the election cycle, and occasionally I even find myself agreeing with his votes on non-housing matters. But two years ago, the day before the election, people started receiving vicious attack flyers and robo-calls from Dennis Carlone's campaign.

        <h2>Paul Mahoney</h2>
        <p>Paul Mahoney is a retired firefighter, and you won't forget it because that's almost all he talks about at candidate events. Issues? Psssh, those aren't important. Mahoney fought <em>fires</em>. His opposition to the Mass + Main development is that it might catch fire.</p>
        <p>When I originally went looking for his platform online, I couldn't find anything except his Facebook page, which involved social niceties with caps lock on and re-shares of Fox News articles.</p>
        <p>His campaign is going nowhere and I see no particular reason to vote for him, but we could technically do worse.</p>
        <p><strong>Drag up if</strong> you're voting to show solidarity with firefighters, instead of based on any issues in particular.</p>

          <h2>Nadeem Mazen</h2>
          <p>Nadeem Mazen is a shameless liar, a narcissist, and a disruptive force who is the root cause of the current divisiveness of Cambridge politics.</p><p>This should be illustrative: At the end of the Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee forum, he declared to everyone's disbelief that <em>he himself</em> is poor. This is a man who owns two businesses and gets paid a City Council salary on top of that. He has so much excess money that he brags about giving away a third of his salary to a "community organization" that sounds a lot like his campaign.</p><p>I could go on for much longer, but don't just take my word for it: I recommend reading <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CambridgeMA/comments/3qbu0u/cambridge_elections_what_are_the_candidates/cwf16ml?context=3">this post</a> by iriscamby, a former Mazen supporter.</p>

          <h2>Romaine Waite</h2>
          <p>Romaine Waite is an unquestioning supporter of Nadeem Mazen. He has barely any platform of his own and is just going to transfer most of his votes to Mazen.</p>

          <h2>Plineo DeGoes</h2>
          <p>Plineo DeGoes is the only candidate explicitly running on behalf of a state political party (the Green-Rainbow Party) in this non-partisan election.</p>
          <p>He wants to solve the housing crunch by inviting homeless people to the city. He doesn't want to give them homes -- he in fact wants a moratorium on construction. He just wants them around to make the city less desirable. Seriously, here's exactly what he wrote in his ABC questionnaire response: "<a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/abettercambridge/pages/138/attachments/original/1444271569/Candidate_full_responses_to_publish.pdf?1444271569">Provide more services to the homeless in order to attract them to the city (which will decrease property values)</a>".</p>

          <h2>Ilan Levy</h2>
          <p>Ilan Levy wants to destroy the unique form of government that makes this ranking possible, and replace it with plurality voting. Like in Boston, where most city council candidates run unopposed.</p>

          <h2>James Williamson</h2>
          <p>James Williamson is unhinged. At candidate forum events, he is so badly behaved that the audience ends up booing him. At the CEOC debate, he accused the moderator -- a volunteer who fights poverty -- of being a "bully" and a shill for other candidates' campaigns, because she wouldn't let him give a completely off-topic statement.</p>

          <h2>Kim Courtney</h2>
          <p>Kim Courtney and Xavier Dietrich ran for City Council as a way of drawing attention to a legal struggle they were having trying to open a wine bar. Now that they've won that legal battle, I hoped they were done campaigning.</p>
          <p>But their next target is Uber (and similar car services). They don't just want to regulate it like the state does, they want to ban it outright. If you're one of the very few people who owns a Cambridge taxi medallion and also lives in Cambridge, I can see why you'd support them. Everyone else should stay away.</p>

    <p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.abettercambridge.org/">A Better Cambridge</a> for publishing their own very useful voter guide, and to Robert Winters and the <a href="http://cambridgecivic.com/">Cambridge Civic Journal</a> for collecting so much information about the candidates.</p>
    <p>I am currently shamelessly hot-linking candidate images from the Cambridge Civic Journal because I'm in a hurry to put this page up. I will host the images myself when I have the time to make the change.</p>
